% Compute the radial and axial conductivities of the roots
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Root conductativities (both radial and axial) for each soil layer are
% obtained by weighting the conductivity of the root system by the root
% distribution within the layer. The effect of soil moisture on root
% conductivity is also taken into account.

    % for radial conductivity, root fraction is used as a weighting factor,
    % because the uptake from a layer is proportional to the total surface 
    % area of roots in that layer. Thus, 
    krad(i,1) = rootfr(i)*K_rad ...
              * vol_liq(i)/eff_porosity(i);          

    % for axial conductivity, root density is used as a weighting factor,
    % because the flow is proportional to the total x-sectional area of  
    % the roots in that layer. Thus,                       
    kax(i,1) = (roottr(i)/dz(i))*K_axs ...
             * vol_liq(i)/eff_porosity(i);
